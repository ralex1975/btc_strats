Could possibly use two different methods-

1: Use the high value to create the signal
2: Use the close value to create the signal and then look up the price at that time for the backtest
    - would the value new threshold values we calculate be based on the close or based on the old threshold values? May
    require two methods here as well for backtesting

Create a series of time-agnostic bars that are only concerned with the price movement of the underlying. We take the
starting value block size and draw the first block once the price has moved above or below the threshold values.

Record the open and close prices of the bars along with a timestamp of the bars close?

Later on, how could we use the length of time or velocity of the trend as useful information?

How could this be used in production without calculating the entire bar series every time? We would need to know the
threshold values from the previous time period.
